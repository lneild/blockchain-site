Hi, I’m Lainey and this site is my deep dive into blockchain, crypto, and some of the most exciting ways this technology is being used beyond just coins and headlines.

As a computer science student heading into a career at the intersection of finance and tech, I kept hearing about blockchain and crypto everywhere, in the news, in interviews, in conversations. But even with all the buzz, none of my classes actually taught me what any of it *really* meant. For a while, I avoided the topic because the jargon felt overwhelming and the headlines were all about volatility.

This project was my way of cutting through the noise. I wanted to understand the core technology behind it all: what makes blockchain so powerful, why it’s different, and what kinds of problems it can solve. From Bitcoin to smart contracts and beyond, I’ve broken things down in a way that makes sense whether you’re a beginner or just looking to sharpen your understanding.

I hope this site helps demystify the space and maybe even gets you a little excited about what the future could look like with this tech in it.
