Cryptocurrency may be the most well-known application of blockchain, but it's far from the only one. In fact, some of the most promising and creative use cases have nothing to do with digital money at all. Just like the internet gave rise to social media, e-commerce, cloud storage, and a million other tools, blockchain is starting to power a new wave of systems built around ownership, automation, and transparency.

At its core, blockchain is a way to coordinate people, resources, and rules without relying on a central authority. That opens the door to fixing a lot of outdated or broken systems.

Let's take a look at a few of the most interesting areas where blockchain is being used for more than just currency.

## The Case for Blockchain and the LLC

### Why LLCs Were Created and Why They're Outdated Today

The concept behind LLCs goes back to the 1800s, during the rise of large infrastructure projects like the building of railroads. These ventures were incredibly expensive and risky, and investors didn't want to lose their homes or life savings if things went wrong. So the idea of limited liability emerged: a legal structure where you could invest in a business, share in the profits, but not be personally responsible for its debts.

That concept eventually evolved into what we now call an LLC—a structure that combines liability protection with flexible ownership and pass-through taxation. At the time, it made sense. It was designed for industrial-era businesses that needed formal hierarchies, legal paperwork, and clear lines between owners and operators.

But today, this system feels clunky and outdated, especially for modern, internet-based businesses. Most LLCs still require:

- Filing through slow, state-level bureaucracies  
- Long, boilerplate operating agreements that nobody reads  
- Manual recordkeeping of who owns what  
- Legal help any time something needs to change  
- Not a lot of automation or transparency  

It wasn't built for global teams, digital-first businesses, or groups that want to operate without middlemen. And that's exactly where blockchain, and more specifically smart contracts, could offer something better.

## What Is a Smart Contract?

A **smart contract** is a self-executing agreement written in code and stored on the blockchain. Once it's deployed, it automatically runs when certain conditions are met. No lawyers, no middlemen, no waiting around for approvals.

Most smart contracts today run on **Ethereum**, one of the most widely used blockchains for applications like this.

Think of it like a vending machine. You put in your money, make a selection, and the machine gives you exactly what you asked for—instantly, without human involvement. A smart contract works the same way, but instead of snacks, it runs logical statements like:

- "If X people vote yes, release funds"  
- "If a new member joins, update ownership shares."  

It's transparent, tamper-proof, and always follows the rules it was programmed with. No one can quietly change the terms later.

## How Smart Contracts Could Replace LLCs

Now imagine replacing your entire LLC agreement with code.

Instead of a 20-page operating agreement in a dusty Google Doc, you have a smart contract that runs your business agreement automatically:

- Ownership shares are tracked on-chain  
- Voting is handled transparently and instantly  
- Profit splits are distributed automatically  
- Any changes like adding a member or exiting the company trigger code that updates everything in real time  
- All transactions, decisions, and roles are visible and verifiable  

No paperwork. No lawyers. No waiting weeks to finalize a change. Just rules, written once, and executed exactly as agreed.

## Why This Is Exciting

With smart contracts, you could build businesses that are born on the internet, operate globally, and manage themselves. You could spin up a company in minutes, onboard team members from anywhere in the world, and know that everyone is held to the same set of transparent rules. No state filing. No messy cap tables. No confusion over who owns what or how decisions get made.

You're no longer limited by geography, bureaucracy, or outdated legal frameworks. You're building companies as code—flexible, programmable, and scalable from day one.

This is already starting to happen with something called a **DAO**, or **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**. A DAO is an organization run by smart contracts instead of managers or executives. The rules are written in code, decisions are made through token-holder voting, and everything happens transparently on the blockchain.

People use DAOs today to manage investment clubs, fund open-source software, and run creative collectives, all without a traditional company structure. But the real potential is much bigger.

Imagine communities, startups, or side hustles that run cleanly, transparently, and without ever needing to hire a lawyer to rewrite the operating agreement again.

It's not just more efficient—it's a whole new way to build.

## Where Could This Go?

If we can run companies on code, why stop there?

A smart contract can handle ownership, rules, and decision-making. So what else in the real world depends on those things? The answer is: almost everything. **Schools. Cities. Even governments.**

Today, laws are written in legal language, interpreted by courts, and carried out by bureaucracies. It's slow, expensive, and often unclear. But what if the rules of a community, or even an entire country, could be written into smart contracts?

At first, that might sound sketchy or extreme. But it's actually safer, more efficient, and more intuitive than the systems we use now. Imagine a nation where:

- Every citizen has a digital ID on-chain  
- Taxes are collected automatically and transparently  
- Public funds are only released when verified milestones are hit  
- Voting is secure, fast, and trustless  
- Laws can be proposed, voted on, and executed with full transparency  

You don't have to trust politicians, middlemen, or institutions—you trust the math, the code, and the shared rules agreed to by the community.

We're not building countries on the blockchain tomorrow. But we are starting small. DAOs are already experimenting with budgets, governance, and self-enforcing rules. The building blocks are here—the only question is how far we're willing to go.

## What Are NFTs?

**NFT** stands for **non-fungible token**. It's a unique digital certificate of ownership stored on the blockchain.

Let's break that down:

- **Non-fungible** means it's one of a kind. Unlike dollars or Bitcoin, where each unit is identical and interchangeable, an NFT represents something specific and unique. That could be a piece of art, a song, a membership pass, or even a plot of virtual land. Think of a rare baseball card—but one that can also unlock real benefits, access, or value.
- The **token** part means it's a digital asset recorded on the blockchain. The blockchain acts as a public ledger that permanently tracks who owns the NFT and when it changes hands.

You can think of an NFT as a **digital receipt or deed**. It proves ownership and authenticity of an item, and that record can't be forged, changed, or deleted.

## NFTs in the Art World

One of the most practical and already widespread uses of NFTs is in the **art world**. Artists—especially painters, photographers, and illustrators—have started using NFTs to protect their work, connect directly with buyers, and earn more over time.

Let's say you're a painter. You create a piece, sell it to a buyer, and that's usually where your involvement ends. You have no way to track it, no claim if it's resold, and no share in its rising value if your career takes off.

Now imagine attaching an NFT to the physical painting. The NFT acts as a digital certificate of ownership and authenticity, tied to the piece. The buyer owns both the artwork and its digital record. This creates new opportunities:

- You can track future resales, even years later  
- You can receive **royalties automatically** when your work is resold (e.g., 2% of every resale)  
- You can prove it's the original without needing a gallery or appraiser  
- You can connect directly with collectors, without giving up a cut to intermediaries  

Instead of being left behind, you stay part of your work's story.

## NFTs as Membership Passes

NFTs don't just represent art or collectibles. They can also act as **access passes**, keys to exclusive communities, experiences, or content.

Take **Tate McRae**, for example. Imagine she launches an exclusive fan club by releasing 1,000 NFTs. Holding one gets you access to:

- Private voice memos  
- Behind-the-scenes footage from tour  
- Early drops of unreleased songs  
- Surprise video calls with fans  

No app, no subscription platform—just direct access between her and the people who support her most.

If Tate's career keeps rising, those tokens can increase in value. Early supporters could later resell their NFTs at a profit, just like owning limited-edition merch that becomes more valuable over time.

**Andreessen Horowitz**, one of the most influential venture capital firms, popularized the idea that every creator only needs to find their **top 1,000 true fans** to build a sustainable career. These aren't casual listeners—they're the people who buy vinyls, attend shows, wear the merch, and stick around.

NFTs make it possible to **identify and reward those true fans**. Instead of a follower count, the artist can see exactly who holds their tokens, how long they've held them, and reward loyalty over time.

They can offer perks, involve fans in creative decisions, and build a career that's powered by community—not platforms.

## Now Zoom Out

Fan clubs are just one example, but the same idea can be applied more broadly.

Take a **gym**, for instance. Instead of monthly billing through a traditional membership system, imagine your access is tied to an NFT. You buy a token that proves you're a member. It might get you into the gym, but also:

- Into exclusive classes  
- Early sign-ups for events  
- Voting rights on what equipment gets upgraded next  

If you move or no longer want the membership, you could **resell the NFT** to someone else—something you can't do with a typical subscription.

Or think about a **neighborhood association**. Instead of paying dues through clunky systems and attending poorly managed meetings, ownership of a digital token could grant you access to:

- Community decisions  
- Budgeting votes  
- Local perks  

Everything is recorded transparently, and everyone plays by the same rules.

---

The core idea is simple: **NFTs turn membership into something programmable, portable, and potentially valuable**. They create alignment between organizations and their members—whether you're a die-hard fan, a regular at the gym, or just want a say in your neighborhood.
