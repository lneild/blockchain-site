Cryptocurrency may be the most well-known application of blockchain, but it's far from the only one. Some of the most promising and creative use cases have nothing to do with digital money. Just like the internet gave rise to social media, e-commerce, and cloud storage, blockchain is powering a new wave of systems built around ownership, automation, and transparency.

At its core, blockchain is a way to coordinate people, resources, and rules without relying on a central authority. That opens the door to fixing a lot of outdated or broken systems.

Here are a few of the most interesting ways blockchain is being used beyond currency.

## The Case for Blockchain and the LLC

### Why LLCs Were Created—and Why They’re Outdated

LLCs emerged in the 1800s during the rise of large, risky infrastructure projects like railroads. Investors needed a way to share in profits without risking their personal assets if things went south. That led to the concept of **limited liability**.

Over time, that evolved into the LLCs we know today: structures that combine liability protection with flexible ownership and pass-through taxation. It worked well for industrial-era businesses built on formal hierarchies and paperwork.

But for modern, internet-based companies, this setup feels outdated. Most LLCs still involve:

- Filing through slow, state-level bureaucracies  
- Long, boilerplate operating agreements no one reads  
- Manual recordkeeping of ownership  
- Legal help anytime something needs to change  
- A lack of automation or transparency  

It wasn’t built for digital-first teams, global contributors, or agile operations. That’s where blockchain—and specifically, smart contracts—can offer something better.

## What Is a Smart Contract?

A **smart contract** is a self-executing agreement written in code and stored on the blockchain. Once deployed, it runs automatically when specific conditions are met. No lawyers, no middlemen, no waiting for signatures.

Most smart contracts today run on **Ethereum**, one of the most widely used blockchain platforms for these kinds of applications.

Think of it like a vending machine: you insert money, make a selection, and get exactly what you paid for—no human needed. A smart contract does the same with logic-based rules:

- "If X people vote yes, release funds"  
- "If a new member joins, update ownership shares"  

They’re transparent, tamper-proof, and enforceable exactly as written. No one can change the terms behind your back.

## How Smart Contracts Could Replace LLCs

Now imagine your entire LLC agreement—ownership, voting, profit sharing—all encoded in a smart contract.

- Ownership shares are tracked on-chain  
- Voting is fast, verifiable, and built into the system  
- Profits are distributed automatically  
- Changes like onboarding or exiting members are handled in real time  
- All activity is recorded and publicly auditable  

No paperwork. No lawyers. No waiting. Just one set of agreed-upon rules that executes as intended.

Now this is exciting! 

Smart contracts could make it possible to build global, self-operating businesses from day one. You could spin up a company in minutes, onboard teammates from anywhere, and know everyone is held to the same transparent rules.

No state filing. No messy cap tables. No ambiguity about who owns what or how decisions get made.

This is already happening through **DAOs**—**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**—which are organizations governed by code, not by managers. The rules are embedded in smart contracts. Token-holders vote. Actions are executed automatically.

DAOs are used today to run investment clubs, fund open-source work, and coordinate creative projects. But the potential is much bigger.

Picture startups, side hustles, or entire communities that function transparently and autonomously—no legal red tape, no gatekeeping.

It’s not just more efficient. It’s a whole new way to build.

## Where Could This Go?

If we can run companies on code, what else could we run?

Smart contracts handle ownership, governance, and logic. And many real-world systems are built on those very things—**schools, cities, even governments**.

Today, rules are written in legal language, interpreted by courts, and carried out by bureaucracies. It’s slow, costly, and often unclear. But what if we could write community rules—maybe even national laws—as code?

It might sound radical, but it could be safer, faster, and more accountable than the systems we have today. Imagine a society where:

- Every citizen has a verified digital ID on-chain  
- Taxes are collected and distributed automatically  
- Public funds are only released when milestones are met  
- Voting is instant, secure, and verifiable  
- Laws are proposed, voted on, and executed transparently  

No need to trust politicians or institutions—you trust the shared rules and the code.

We’re not building nations on the blockchain tomorrow. But we are already experimenting. DAOs are piloting these ideas on a smaller scale. The technology is here. The real question is: how far do we want to take it?

## What Are NFTs?

**NFT** stands for **non-fungible token**—a unique digital record of ownership stored on the blockchain.

Here’s the breakdown:

- **Non-fungible** means it’s unique. One NFT isn’t interchangeable with another, unlike a dollar or a Bitcoin. NFTs represent specific items—art, music, memberships, even virtual real estate.  
- A **token** is a digital asset that lives on the blockchain. The blockchain acts like a public ledger, tracking who owns what and when ownership changes hands.

You can think of NFTs as **digital receipts** or **deeds**. They prove ownership and authenticity—and that proof can’t be forged or deleted.

## NFTs in the Art World

One of the most impactful real-world uses for NFTs has been in the **art world**. Artists—especially digital creators—use NFTs to sell their work, connect with collectors, and earn more over time.

Traditionally, if you sell a painting, that’s the end of the story. You don’t benefit if the piece is resold, and you can’t track where it ends up.

NFTs change that. You can attach an NFT to your work and:

- Track future resales  
- Automatically earn royalties (e.g., 2% of every resale)  
- Prove originality without needing a gallery  
- Connect directly with collectors  

It keeps the artist part of the work’s story—even after it changes hands.

## NFTs as Membership Passes

NFTs aren’t just for art—they can also function as **digital access passes** to exclusive content, communities, or experiences.

Take **Tate McRae**, for example. Say she releases 1,000 NFTs to her fanbase. Holders might get access to:

- Private voice memos  
- Behind-the-scenes tour footage  
- Early releases of songs  
- Surprise video calls  

No need for a subscription platform—just direct connection between her and her fans.

If her popularity rises, those NFTs might grow in value too. Early fans could resell them, like rare merch with built-in perks.

Venture firm **Andreessen Horowitz** has popularized the idea that creators only need their **top 1,000 true fans** to build sustainable careers. NFTs help identify and engage those fans—offering perks, sharing creative control, and deepening loyalty.

Instead of followers, creators have provable supporters.

## Now Zoom Out

Fan clubs are just the beginning. The same idea scales.

Imagine a **gym** that uses NFTs instead of monthly billing. Your NFT gets you access to:

- Facilities  
- Exclusive classes  
- Priority event registration  
- Voting rights on new equipment  

If you move away or want out, you could resell the NFT—something you can’t do with a typical subscription.

Or think about a **neighborhood association**. Instead of paying dues through clunky systems, members hold a token that gives them:

- Access to meetings  
- Voting rights  
- Local perks  

Everything is recorded transparently. Everyone plays by the same rules.

---

The core idea is simple: **NFTs make membership programmable, portable, and potentially valuable**. They align incentives between groups and their members—whether you’re a fan, a gym-goer, or a neighbor. That’s where the real potential lies.
