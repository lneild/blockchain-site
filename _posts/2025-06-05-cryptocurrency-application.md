Cryptocurrency is probably the most well-known use case of blockchain technology. It's what most people think of when they hear "blockchain." While blockchain is the underlying infrastructure, crypto is one of the biggest and earliest apps built on top of it. Think of blockchain like the internet, and crypto like one of the major platforms it powers.

At its core, cryptocurrency is digital money—created, stored, and transferred on the blockchain. But unlike dollars in a bank account, it isn’t issued by governments or stored in centralized systems.

There are many types of crypto, and not all are trying to be “money.” Here’s a breakdown of the main categories you'll encounter.

### Payment Cryptocurrencies

Payment cryptocurrencies are designed to work like digital cash. You can send them to someone else directly—no banks, no payment apps, no middlemen.

The most famous example is **Bitcoin**. It’s decentralized, meaning no government or company controls it. And unlike traditional currency, Bitcoin has a **fixed supply** of 21 million coins. That’s hardcoded and can’t be changed, making it resistant to inflation—more like **digital gold** than everyday cash.

Other examples like **Litecoin** and **Bitcoin Cash** were created to improve on Bitcoin’s limitations, particularly its transaction speed and fees. Mining each Bitcoin block takes about 10 minutes, so transactions can be slow and costly during busy periods. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash aim to solve that by making payments faster and cheaper.

If Bitcoin is like a vault—slow, secure, and high-value—Litecoin is more like a debit card: same function, just quicker and more practical for daily use. Together, they show the different ways payment crypto can evolve around the same basic idea: money without banks.

### Utility Tokens

Not all crypto is about spending or saving. Some tokens exist to grant access—to tools, services, or spaces within a particular platform. These are called **utility tokens**, and they function more like credits than cash.

A common misconception is that all crypto is about finance. But in many cases, crypto is what powers decentralized apps. A good example is **Ethereum**.

Ethereum is more than a currency—it’s a platform where developers build apps for gaming, finance, communication, and more. To use any of these features, you need **ETH**, Ethereum’s native token. It’s what you pay to interact with the network.

Imagine every part of your life had its own token. A grocery token. A gas token. A token to access your favorite app. If you don’t drive, gas tokens mean nothing to you. But if you’re a daily commuter, they’re essential. That’s how utility tokens work: they unlock specific functionality within specific ecosystems.

Their value isn’t in how much they’re worth in dollars—it’s in what they let you do.

### Stablecoins

**Stablecoins** are cryptocurrencies designed to keep a steady value, often pegged to something like the US dollar. In most cases, 1 stablecoin equals $1.

Examples include **USDC** and **Tether (USDT)**. These are backed by dollar reserves or short-term assets to maintain price stability. The goal? Combine the speed and accessibility of crypto with the consistency of traditional money.

So why use a stablecoin?

- To send money quickly and cheaply—especially across borders  
- To store value in a more stable form, especially in countries with inflation  
- To reduce exposure to volatility: crypto traders often move into stablecoins to lock in profits or avoid short-term swings  

Stablecoins don’t try to reinvent money. They just make it easier to move, store, and use without needing a traditional bank.

### Central Bank Digital Currencies

While most cryptocurrencies aim to move away from government control, **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** do the opposite. They're created by governments and issued by central banks.

Think of CBDCs as digital versions of existing currencies—like a digital dollar or euro—built with blockchain-inspired tech but fully controlled by the government.

At first glance, they resemble stablecoins: predictable value, easy digital transfers. But unlike decentralized crypto, CBDCs are **centralized**. Governments decide how they’re issued, tracked, and used. They can reverse or block transactions, and the system isn’t open-source or anonymous.

So what’s the point of CBDCs?

- **Faster payments**: instant transfers, even without a bank  
- **Modernized infrastructure**: upgrades old payment rails  
- **More control over monetary policy**  
- **Less reliance on physical cash**, which is expensive to manage  

This raises privacy concerns. CBDCs could let governments track spending or restrict usage. Some people are fine with that—it’s similar to digital banking today. Others see it as a major red flag.

CBDCs aren't meant to compete with decentralized crypto. They aim to modernize the existing system—not replace it.

### Meme Coins: Trend or Distraction?

Recently, **meme coins** have dominated headlines. Tokens named after dogs, frogs, and celebrities are suddenly everywhere—along with stories of people striking it rich… or losing it all.

So where do meme coins actually fit in?

Coins like **Dogecoin**, **Shiba Inu**, and **Pepe** often start as jokes. They usually have no fixed supply, no clear use case, and no product roadmap. They’re not for payments, don’t provide access to apps, aren’t stable, and definitely aren’t issued by central banks.

What they do have is hype, community, and attention.

But meme coins are risky. They’re highly volatile, often manipulated, and prone to scams. **Rug pulls**—where creators vanish with all the money—are common. There’s little regulation or transparency.

That doesn’t mean they’re all bad. Just that they should be handled with caution. Meme coins aren't what makes crypto innovative—they're more of a cultural byproduct.

The real power of crypto lies in what it can build: secure systems, open platforms, and entirely new ways of interacting with money and technology.

Meme coins may come and go, but the underlying tech has the potential to reshape how the world works.
