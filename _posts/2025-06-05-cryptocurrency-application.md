Cryptocurrency is arguably the most well-known and widely used application built on blockchain technology. It's what most people think of when they hear "blockchain" in the first place. While blockchain is the underlying infrastructure, crypto is one of the main things we use it for. Think of blockchain as the internet, and crypto as one of its biggest apps.

At its core, cryptocurrency is digital money: created, stored, and transferred on the blockchain. But unlike dollars in a bank account, crypto isn't issued by governments, and it doesn't sit in a centralized system.

There are many types of crypto, and not all of them are trying to be "money." Let's break down the categories we hear about most often.

### Payment Cryptocurrencies

Payment cryptocurrencies are designed to work like digital cash. You can send them to someone else without going through a bank, credit card company, or payment app. That means no middlemen, no delays, and no one taking a cut.

The best-known example is **Bitcoin**. It was built to be decentralized, meaning no government or company controls it. And unlike traditional currency, there will only ever be **21 million bitcoins**. This finite supply is baked into the code and can't be changed, which makes Bitcoin resistant to inflation—a distinct advantage compared to how governments can print more money whenever they want. This makes Bitcoin more like **digital gold** than digital cash.

Other examples include **Litecoin** and **Bitcoin Cash**. These were created to address some of Bitcoin's limitations, mainly transaction speed and fees. Remember the mining process we talked about in section 1? It takes around 10 minutes to mine each block, meaning it takes roughly 10 minutes for transactions to get processed. So Bitcoin is secure, but it's relatively slow and can get expensive to use when the network is busy because of computational power. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash aim to make everyday payments faster and cheaper.

Think of it like this: if Bitcoin is a vault, secure and slow-moving, Litecoin is more like a debit card. Same idea, but faster and more practical for day-to-day use. These alternatives show how the payment crypto category can branch out while still sticking to the same basic idea: digital money, no bank required.

### Utility Tokens

Not all cryptocurrencies are trying to be money. Some are designed to give you access to something, like a tool, feature, or space, within a specific system. These are called **utility tokens**, and they're used more like credits or passes than cash.

A common misconception about blockchain and crypto is that it's all just finance, especially since it's called *cryptocurrency*. But not all crypto is used as money. Some tokens are used for entirely different purposes, like powering apps or granting access to a platform.

This idea can be hard to grasp at first, since it shifts away from the Venmo-style mental model we've been using. So let's start with a clear example: **Ethereum**.

Ethereum isn't just a currency—it's a platform where people can build and use different tools and services, things like games, finance tools, or communication systems, all running on the Ethereum network. But to use any of these features, you have to pay in **ETH**, Ethereum's native token. Whether you're storing data, accessing a service, or using computing power, ETH is what makes the system run.

Imagine a world where each part of daily life has its own token. You don't use the same money to buy groceries, pay rent, and fill up your gas tank. Instead, you use a grocery token, a housing token, and a gas token. If you don't own a car, the gas token is useless to you. But if you drive every day, it's essential. This situation helps explain the logic behind utility tokens.

These tokens are meant to serve specific purposes within specific platforms. You're not holding them to spend at a coffee shop—you're holding them because they let you access, use, or interact with a particular system. Their value comes from what they let you do, not just what they're worth in dollars.

### Stablecoins

**Stablecoins** are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a consistent value, usually by being pegged to something stable like the US dollar. In most cases, 1 stablecoin is always meant to equal $1.

Popular examples include **USDC** and **Tether (USDT)**. These coins are backed by reserves like dollars, short-term assets, or other forms of collateral, to keep their value steady. The idea is to combine the speed and flexibility of crypto with the predictability of traditional currency.

So why would someone actually want to use a stablecoin?

- To move money quickly and cheaply across borders, without banks, delays, or high fees  
- To store value in a more stable asset, especially in countries where local currencies are unstable or inflating  
- To step out of the volatility: crypto traders often convert their holdings into stablecoins when they want to "lock in" gains or avoid losses, without converting back to traditional currency  

In short, stablecoins offer a way to operate inside the crypto ecosystem while avoiding the price swings. They're not trying to reinvent money—just make it easier and faster to move and hold, without needing a traditional bank.

### Central Bank Digital Currencies

While most cryptocurrencies are built to be independent from governments, **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** are the opposite. They're created and issued by governments.

Think of it as a digital version of your country's currency, like a digital dollar, euro, or yuan. They are built using some of the same tech principles as crypto, but fully controlled by the central bank.

At first glance, a CBDC might look similar to something like a stablecoin. The value is steady, and it's meant to move easily between people and businesses. But the difference is who runs it.

CBDCs are **centralized**, meaning the government controls everything: how it's issued, where it can be spent, how transactions are tracked, and even whether they can be reversed or frozen. This is very different from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where no single entity has that level of control.

At this point, you might be wondering: *Wasn't the whole point of crypto to move away from government control? So why would anyone use a CBDC?*

Fair question.

CBDCs aren't meant to replace decentralized crypto—they serve a different purpose. They're designed to modernize traditional money and payment systems, not disrupt them. For most people, they could make everyday payments faster, easier, and more accessible, especially for those without stable access to banks.

So why are governments exploring CBDCs?

- **Faster payments**: people can send money instantly, even without a bank  
- **Modernized infrastructure**: it updates old payment rails with newer tech  
- **Better monetary control**: central banks can more directly influence the money supply  
- **Reduced need for physical cash**: cash is expensive to print, manage, and distribute  

That said, CBDCs raise important questions around **privacy and control**. Since the government runs the system, it could in theory track spending, block transactions, or limit how and where money is used. For some, that's a dealbreaker; for others, it's no different than how digital banking already works.

So while CBDCs use similar tech as crypto, they come from a very different place—one focused on upgrading the existing financial system rather than reinventing it.

### Meme Coins? Where do they fit in?

Lately, **meme coins** have taken over the spotlight in most crypto news. That's what dominates headlines: coins named after dogs, frogs, or celebrities. And half the time, the stories involve someone making millions overnight... or losing everything.

So where do meme coins actually fit in? Are they part of the future of crypto, or just internet noise?

Meme coins often start as jokes. Coins like **Dogecoin**, **Shiba Inu**, or newer trends like **Pepe** weren't created to solve a technical problem or power an ecosystem. They often have no fixed supply, no product roadmap, and no real-world use. They don't really fit into any of the four categories above: they're not designed for payments, they don't unlock specific utility, they aren't stable, and they're definitely not issued by central banks. What they do have is attention, hype, and community.

But meme coins come with risks. Most meme coins are **extremely volatile**, easy to manipulate, and vulnerable to scams. **Rug pulls** are common—this is when the creators of a coin suddenly pull out all the invested money, shut everything down, and disappear, leaving everyone else with worthless tokens. The creators are left with all the profits, while the community is left holding the bag. There's often no regulation, no transparency, and no recourse.

That doesn't mean all meme coins are bad, just that they should be approached with caution. They aren't foundational to blockchain technology, and they don't represent what makes crypto powerful or promising.

So while meme coins tend to dominate the headlines, they shouldn't distract from the **real innovation** happening in this space. Yes, they reflect how culture, speculation, and internet identity all show up in crypto—but they aren't the core of what makes the technology valuable.

Crypto is built on some incredibly cool and potentially revolutionary ideas, from secure transactions to entirely new ways of building applications and systems. Don't let the hype around meme coins discourage you from exploring it.

The foundation of blockchain is about more than speculation. It's about **rebuilding systems from the ground up**. Meme coins may come and go, but that core idea is what really matters.
