Cryptocurrency is arguably the most well-known and widely used application built on blockchain technology. It is what most people think of when they hear "blockchain" for the first time. While blockchain is the underlying infrastructure, crypto is one of the main things we use it for. You can think of blockchain as the internet and crypto as one of its biggest apps.

At its core, cryptocurrency is digital money. It is created, stored, and transferred on the blockchain. But unlike dollars in a bank account, crypto is not issued by governments and it does not sit in a centralized system.

There are many types of crypto, and not all of them are trying to be digital money. Let’s break down the categories we hear about most often.

### Payment Cryptocurrencies

Payment cryptocurrencies are designed to work like digital cash. You can send them to someone else without going through a bank, credit card company, or payment app. That means no middlemen, no delays, and no one taking a cut.

The best-known example is Bitcoin. It was built to be decentralized, meaning no government or company controls it. Unlike traditional currency, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This fixed supply is written into the code and cannot be changed. That makes Bitcoin resistant to inflation and gives it a distinct advantage over currencies that can be printed in unlimited amounts. In that way, Bitcoin is more like digital gold than digital cash.

Other examples include Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. These were created to address some of Bitcoin’s limitations, especially when it comes to transaction speed and fees. The mining process takes about 10 minutes per block, so each transaction can take roughly 10 minutes to be confirmed. Bitcoin is secure, but it is relatively slow and can become expensive when the network is busy. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash aim to make everyday payments faster and cheaper.

You can think of it this way: if Bitcoin is a vault that is secure and slow-moving, Litecoin is more like a debit card. It serves the same purpose, but it is faster and more practical for daily use. These alternatives show how the payment crypto category can evolve while still sticking to the same basic idea: digital money with no need for a bank.

### Utility Tokens

Not all cryptocurrencies are trying to be money. Some are designed to give you access to something, such as a feature, a tool, or a digital space. These are called utility tokens. They are used more like credits or access passes than like cash.

A common misconception is that crypto is all about finance. The word "currency" makes it sound like it is only about money. But not all crypto is meant to be spent. Some tokens are used for entirely different purposes, such as powering apps or giving access to a service. This can feel unfamiliar
