## Section 2: Crypto

Cryptocurrency is arguably the most well-known and widely used application built on blockchain technology. It is what most people think of when they hear "blockchain" for the first time. While blockchain is the underlying infrastructure, crypto is one of the main things we use it for. You can think of blockchain as the internet and crypto as one of its biggest apps.

At its core, cryptocurrency is digital money. It is created, stored, and transferred on the blockchain. But unlike dollars in a bank account, crypto is not issued by governments and it does not sit in a centralized system.

There are many types of crypto, and not all of them are trying to be digital money. Let’s break down the categories we hear about most often.

### Payment Cryptocurrencies

Payment cryptocurrencies are designed to work like digital cash. You can send them to someone else without going through a bank, credit card company, or payment app. That means no middlemen, no delays, and no one taking a cut.

The best-known example is Bitcoin. It was built to be decentralized, meaning no government or company controls it. Unlike traditional currency, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This fixed supply is written into the code and cannot be changed. That makes Bitcoin resistant to inflation and gives it a distinct advantage over currencies that can be printed in unlimited amounts. In that way, Bitcoin is more like digital gold than digital cash.

Other examples include Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. These were created to address some of Bitcoin’s limitations, especially when it comes to transaction speed and fees. The mining process takes about 10 minutes per block, so each transaction can take roughly 10 minutes to be confirmed. Bitcoin is secure, but it is relatively slow and can become expensive when the network is busy. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash aim to make everyday payments faster and cheaper.

You can think of it this way: if Bitcoin is a vault that is secure and slow-moving, Litecoin is more like a debit card. It serves the same purpose, but it is faster and more practical for daily use. These alternatives show how the payment crypto category can evolve while still sticking to the same basic idea: digital money with no need for a bank.

### Utility Tokens

Not all cryptocurrencies are trying to be money. Some are designed to give you access to something, such as a feature, a tool, or a digital space. These are called utility tokens. They are used more like credits or access passes than like cash.

A common misconception is that crypto is all about finance. The word "currency" makes it sound like it is only about money. But not all crypto is meant to be spent. Some tokens are used for entirely different purposes, such as powering apps or giving access to a service. This can feel unfamiliar at first because it moves away from the payment-style examples we are used to.

One clear example is Ethereum. Ethereum is not just a currency. It is a platform where people build apps and services such as games, finance tools, or messaging systems. All of these tools run on the Ethereum network. But to use any of them, you need to pay in ETH, which is Ethereum’s native token. ETH is required whether you are storing data, accessing services, or using computing power. It is the fuel that keeps the system running.

Imagine a world where each part of your life has its own token. You might use a grocery token at the store, a housing token to pay rent, and a gas token to fill your tank. If you do not own a car, the gas token means nothing to you. If you drive every day, it becomes essential. That is how utility tokens work.

Their value comes from what they allow you to do, not just what they are worth in dollars. You are not using them to buy coffee. You are holding them because they give you access to a specific function inside a specific platform.

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to hold a consistent value. Most of them are pegged to something stable like the US dollar. In most cases, one stablecoin is always intended to equal one dollar.

Examples include USDC and Tether (USDT). These tokens are backed by reserves such as cash, short-term assets, or other forms of collateral to keep their price steady. The goal is to combine the speed and openness of crypto with the reliability of traditional currency.

So why would someone use a stablecoin?

- To move money quickly and cheaply across borders, without banks or high fees  
- To store value in a more stable asset, especially in countries where the local currency is inflating  
- To reduce risk in a volatile market, such as when crypto traders want to lock in profits without leaving the crypto ecosystem  

In short, stablecoins allow people to stay inside the world of crypto while avoiding the wild price swings. They are not trying to reinvent money. They are just making it easier and faster to hold and move value without needing a traditional bank.

### Central Bank Digital Currencies

Most cryptocurrencies are built to work outside of governments. Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDCs, are the opposite. They are created and managed by governments.

A CBDC is a digital version of your country’s currency. It might be a digital dollar, euro, or yuan. It uses some of the same technology as crypto, but it is fully controlled by the central bank.

At first glance, a CBDC might seem similar to a stablecoin. Its value is stable, and it is meant to make payments easy and fast. The big difference is who runs it.

CBDCs are centralized. The government controls how they are issued, where they can be spent, how they are tracked, and whether transactions can be reversed or blocked. This is very different from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where no one person or group has that kind of power.

You might ask, if the goal of crypto is to reduce government control, why would anyone use a CBDC?

CBDCs are not meant to replace decentralized crypto. They are meant to modernize traditional money. They could help make payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible for everyone, especially for people who do not have reliable access to banks.

Governments are interested in CBDCs for several reasons:

- Faster and cheaper payments, even without a bank  
- Updated financial infrastructure with newer technology  
- More control over monetary policy and money supply  
- Reduced cost and complexity of printing and managing physical cash  

Of course, CBDCs raise questions about privacy and control. Since governments manage the system, they could track spending or limit how and where money is used. For some people, this is concerning. For others, it is no different from how digital banking already works.

CBDCs use some of the same tech as crypto, but they serve a very different purpose. They aim to improve the current financial system rather than replace it.

### Meme Coins: Where Do They Fit In?

Meme coins have taken over much of the media attention around crypto. These are the tokens that make headlines—coins named after dogs, frogs, or celebrities. Often, they come with stories of people making huge gains overnight or losing everything just as quickly.

So where do meme coins actually fit in? Are they part of the future of crypto or just noise?

Meme coins usually start as jokes. Coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe were not created to solve a problem or power a platform. They often do not have a fixed supply, a product roadmap, or a real-world use. They do not fit the categories we talked about. They are not built for payments, do not provide utility, are not stable, and are not issued by governments. What they have instead is hype and community attention.

These coins are extremely volatile and often used in pump-and-dump schemes. Scams like rug pulls are common. This is where the developers drain the liquidity and disappear, leaving buyers with worthless tokens. There are usually no regulations or safety nets.

That does not mean every meme coin is a scam. Some people enjoy trading them and being part of a community. But they are risky and should be approached with caution. They are not the core of what makes blockchain or crypto valuable.

While meme coins dominate the headlines, they are not the most important part of the ecosystem. They reflect culture, speculation, and internet trends, but they do not define the technology. Crypto is about more than jokes and price swings. It is about creating new systems for ownership, coordination, and value exchange.

The foundation of blockchain is much deeper than speculation. Meme coins may rise and fall, but the real innovation is in how we build and share systems using this technology.
